            <h3>About</h3>
            <p>
                A powerful, deadly sorcerer and one of the primary villains in the Mortal Kombat franchise, Shang Tsung is a shape-shifter who needs to consume souls in order to sustain his health and life. In the Mortal Kombat series, he is the epitome of cunning and decadence, as symbolized by his preference for lavish parties, grand palaces, and stylish clothing. Unlike the crude Shao Kahn, this bombast is a facade, disguising Shang Tsung's true intellectual and mental sophistication. Despite this, he is usually depicted as Shao Kahn's subordinate, following whatever orders the Emperor give him. Through sorcery and experimentation, he is the creator of Meat and the half-Tarkatan Mileena. Due to being the maker of Kronika's Crown, he is one of the few mortals with the ability to use it without strain on his body, something not even the immortal Fujin could do.

                Much like Shao Kahn, as a major antagonist to the franchise, Shang Tsung has made many allies while also drawing the ire to many of the protagonists of the series. Goro and Reptile are often depicted as close allies to the sorcerer, the former being his prized Champion while the latter as his personal bodyguard. He is the arch-nemesis of Liu Kang, which in turn has brought him into conflict with other members of the Shaolin Monks such as Kung Lao, due to the sorcerer's hand in killing his ancestor, The Great Kung Lao. Despite his hostilities towards Earthrealm and its inhabitants, he is respectful of that of Raiden, often referring to him as "Lord Raiden". He is also responsible for blinding the telekinetic swordsman Kenshi.

                Shang Tsung's allegiance to Shao Kahn granted him the status of a free roaming sorcerer. As such, he is able to move between realms without detection by the Elder Gods or local deities, an ability which has granted him many opportunities to commit atrocities over the centuries. Only Delia, Shinnok, Shao Kahn, and Quan Chi can match Shang Tsung's skills as a sorcerer.</p>
